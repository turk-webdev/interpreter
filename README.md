# Interpreter
## Project Info
For this project, we were required to build an interpreter that could take bytecode from the language "X", and execute it.
We were given 3 bytecode files: factorial.x.cod, fib.x.cod, and functionArgsTest.x.cod. The interpreter would read the file and execute the commands within the Runtime Stack that we built. My final grade on this project was 97.1% (A).

## Running the project
To run this project, simply clone this repo and run Interpreter.java, passing one of the 3 bytecode files as an argument when running from the command line.
